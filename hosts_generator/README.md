## Host file to be used for adhell3

### Default adhell3 file: https://gitlab.com/fusionjack/hosts/raw/master/hosts

This host file has been created specifically for use with my adhell3; It is based on the following sources:

* [Dan Pollock](http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts)
* [Adguard Mobile Filter](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/11.txt)
* [yoyo.org](https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=0)
* [disconnect.me simple ad](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_ad.txt)
* [disconnect.me simple malvertising](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_malvertising.txt)
* [disconnect.me simple malware](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_malware.txt)
* [disconnect.me simple tracking](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_tracking.txt)
* [AdAway](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdAway/adaway.github.io/master/hosts.txt)
* [StevenBlack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts)
* [MVPS](https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt)

#### Blacklist recommendations
These domains are annoyances that cannot be included in the main host-file due to issues that may arise as a result of blocking them.
* **graph.facebook.com** (Facebook Ad Choices; can break Facebook login etc.)

#### Whitelist recommendations
These domains may need to be whitelisted for certain sites to function correctly.
* **analytics.twitter.com** (reports of broken twitter links)
